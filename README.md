## My attempts to solve all exercises from SICP

[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) (SICP) is a great computer science textbook by MIT professors Harold Abelson and  Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. It teaches about fundamental principles of programming, programming language design and implementation.

I had made several attempts to finish this book and by finishing I mean doing all exercises from it. The first attempt failed on the first chapter, the second one went quite a long way, I finished around 65% of all exercises. This would be my third attempt and I hope I'll deal with this book and close this gestalt for good.
